# ChooseAMovie

ChooseAMovie is a simple web app that helps a group pick a movie (or show) to watch together.

One person creates a group, sets a few filters (movies vs shows, allowed ratings, genres, streaming services), then shares a link. Everyone joins and rates titles with a 1–5 star system or skips. The app ranks titles based on the group’s ratings to help the group quickly agree on something to watch.

## MVP Features (in progress)

- Share an invite link, let others join with a name
- Browse titles and rate 1–5 stars or skip
